# Data-recording-for-clinical-studies
>Wlecome to our Capstone project, we can save some code in here.
###Attention 
>*Considering that the software platforms we use are different, we can do our best to carry out the project in parallel* 
**In other word**: for example to make an app, if two people can do it, but the code language and hosting platform are different, we can do two versions APP, that is, two codes. In the end, we choose to submit a code that implements better. 
**Note**: not everyone has to do it, you can also choose not to do it if you have never had a similar experience and don't know how to do. But at least one person need to do it, otherwise our mission will not be able to be completed
## How to do
>you can **fork** this repositiory and creat one file of your code in here, just commit is OK.
*Or*, creat a new repositiory using your Github account, and copy the link to our Trello[Comments below github].
###Ending
>if you have any good idea, We can discuss together. Maybe my approach is not the best. Hoping we can learn from each other and make progress. it will must be a meaningful process
